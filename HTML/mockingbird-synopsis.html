      <p class="summary">
        To Kill a Mockingbird takes place in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Great Depression. The protagonist is Jean Louise (“Scout”) Finch, an intelligent though unconventional girl who ages from six to nine years old during the course of the novel. She is raised with her brother, Jeremy Atticus (“Jem”), by their widowed father, Atticus Finch. He is a prominent lawyer who encourages his children to be empathetic and just. He notably tells them that it is “a sin to kill a mockingbird,” alluding to the fact that the birds are innocent and harmless.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="summary">
        When Tom Robinson, one of the town's Black residents, is falsely accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a white woman, Atticus agrees to defend him despite threats from the community. At one point he faces a mob intent on lynching his client but refuses to abandon him. Scout unwittingly diffuses the situation. Although Atticus presents a defense that gives a more plausible interpretation of the evidence—that Mayella was attacked by her father, Bob Ewell—Tom is convicted, and he is later killed while trying to escape custody. A character compares his death to “the senseless slaughter of songbirds,” paralleling Atticus's saying about the mockingbird.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="summary">
        The children, meanwhile, play out their own miniaturized drama of prejudice and superstition as they become interested in Arthur (“Boo”) Radley, a reclusive neighbour who is a local legend. They have their own ideas about him and cannot resist the allure of trespassing on the Radley property. Their speculations thrive on the dehumanization perpetuated by their elders. Atticus, however, reprimands them and tries to encourage a more sensitive attitude. Boo makes his presence felt indirectly through a series of benevolent acts, finally intervening when Bob Ewell attacks Jem and Scout. Boo kills Ewell, but Heck Tate, the sheriff, believes it is better to say that Ewell's death occurred when he fell on his own knife, sparing the shy Boo from unwanted attention. Scout agrees, noting that to do otherwise would be “sort of like shootin' a mockingbird.”

                It is one of the best books that I read. Initially, when I was reading this novel, I did not like this novel.  But as soon as I read it, I started getting interested in this novel. if you understand its symbolic meaning and the depth of its themes. You have to look deep to realize that every letter in this book is placed with a purpose and cherish its developed characters.It's a story that revolves around a sibling which are Scout and Jem and their lives. Which gives unexpected shapes while living with their single parent which is their Father Atticus and caretaker Calpurnia. The Author uses emotions, struggles, hatred and fear during that time of history.

                This book has cured me of all of my terminal illnesses.
                The plot of this book is even better than the Inheritance Cycle, and has hooked me so well that I've been calling out of work sick simply so I can read this book.

              <p>
                Honestly, this book is really amazing & unique from all the fiction books I've read. It was quite confusing in the start; first chapter was quite slow but as further I dig in, it kept going engaging and interesting. And the best thing is that it has so much profound characters & from them you can learn some great life lessons. The topics discussed in this book includes racial prejudice in America, struggle, injustice, cruelty and much more...there are times when it make you angry, make you laugh, make you smile and maybe make you cry in the end...I don't read books & novels at all... this was prob my 8th book and I would say the best so far...A must read book, I'd say!!
